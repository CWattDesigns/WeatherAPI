# WeatherAPI
Complete weather application written in Python using a tutorial by NeuralNine. I used this to get more practice in Python and more practice using API requests and responses.

This application takes user-input for a city, then makes an API call to openweathermap.
The response outputs:
1. The temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit
2. The temperature feels like in Celsius and Fahrenheit
3. The humidity as a percentage
4. Wind speed in the city in m/s
5. A general weather description
6. When the sun rises
7. When the sun sets
